## Overview

This guide installs Bolt Launcher which includes RuneLite integration. Note that Simba must be installed separately - this script does not install Simba.

## Install Bolt Launcher

```bash
# Download installation script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Torwent/wasp-setup/master/linux/bolt-setup.sh

# Make executable
chmod +x bolt-setup.sh

# Run installer
./bolt-setup.sh

# Log out and log back in after installation
```

The script installs all dependencies, builds Bolt, and configures RuneLite profiles automatically.

## Uninstall Bolt Launcher

```bash
# Download uninstallation script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Torwent/wasp-setup/master/linux/bolt-uninstall.sh

# Make executable
chmod +x bolt-uninstall.sh

# Run uninstaller
./bolt-uninstall.sh
```

## Usage

Launch from application menu or run `bolt` in terminal.

## Troubleshooting

Java issues? Check version with `java -version` (should be Java 17).
